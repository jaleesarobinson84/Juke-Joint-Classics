# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Name and Description
- Name: 
    Juke Joint Classics

- Description:
    We named our application "Juke Joint Classics" because we envisioned it as a departure from the typical food recipe apps out there. As devedlopers we tried to
    capture the essence of a traditional Juke Joint- where the atmosphere is laid-back, unpretentious and brimming with life. Think great live music, lively conversation and of course fantanstic food. We wanted our users to feel like they're stepping into a juke joint everytime they open the app - where the vibe is always fun, food is always good and the memories are unforgettable!
    
    Our aim with the application is to bring back the soulful essence of cooking, whether it's a reintroduction or a first-time experience for our users. We want
    to take them on a visual journey reminiscent of the vibrant environment of a juke joint, where the joys of cooking is celebrated with every flavor.

    These hand-picked recipes are the cornerstone elements of a memorable gathering. Each recipe captures the feeling of a good time!
