          <p class="dessert-card-text">Sweet Potato Pie Ingredients
Sweet Potatoes I like to use medium sweet potatoes.
Butter Softened butter will mix more easily into the baked sweet potatoes when making this pie.
Sugar My family has traditionally used granulated sugar for this pie. If you are looking for a brown sugar version, I’ve included how to make it later in this article and in the recipe notes.
Vanilla extract The vanilla extract enhances the flavor of the pie. I do recommend using pure vanilla extract rather than imitation vanilla flavoring as I believe you can taste the difference in the baked pie. 
Eggs You'll need 2 large eggs for this pie recipe. I also like to have them at room temperature to mix into the pie filling more easily. 
Milk Use your preference of whole milk, heavy cream, or evaporated milk in this recipe. You will not want to use a lower fat content milk.
Unbaked Pie Crust There is NO need to pre-bake these pie crusts. While I hope you try my homemade pie crust recipe, you can also use your favorite 9-inch pie crusts from the store if you wish.
Step by Step Instructions
This pie is so simple to make! Here's how I make it:

Bake Sweet Potatoes. Once baked and slightly cooled, peel the skins off of the sweet potatoes and place them into a large mixing bowl.

Make the Sweet Potato Pie Filling. Heat oven to 350º F. Mash the peeled sweet potatoes with the softened butter. Add the sugar(s) and the vanilla extract and mix until well combined and pour in the milk and eggs. Mix until the mixture is well combined. I use a simple potato masher, but you can also use an electric mixer if you prefer.</p>

          <p class="dessert-card-text">Grab These Ingredients
Pecans: Can't make pecan pie without them!
Eggs: Eggs bind the ingredients and hold the filling together.
Corn Syrup: Sweetens, holds the filling together, and helps prevent crystallization while the pie bakes. I prefer dark corn syrup here for intensified flavor. See below if you’re interested in pie without corn syrup.
Brown Sugar: You can use light or dark brown sugar; dark has a little deeper flavor, with its higher molasses content.
Pure Vanilla Extract: One of the key flavors.
Butter: Melted butter makes for the best buttery flavor.
Salt: A little salt balances the sweet, and is especially welcome in a pie made with nuts.
Cinnamon: Cinnamon adds an extra layer of flavor! I don’t see many pecan pies with cinnamon; so thank you, Grandma, for giving me the opportunity to present a slightly unique pecan pie on our Thanksgiving tables.</p>
